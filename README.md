# Kinematic-analysis-of-4-Bar-mechanism-using-Newton-Raphson-method

This repository contains the Kinematic analysis done on 4-Bar mechanism as an assignment for course MCL-738: MultiBody Dynamics.  
The non-linear kinematic equations were numerically solved using **Newton-Euler** method.  
Results can be seen in **Mathematical model and results.pdf**
